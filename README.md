## Executive Summary
Orion Data Systems required deeper visibility into its workforce data to support strategic human resource and operational decisions. The HR & Strategy team needed answers to key questions around employee distribution, salary structure, job roles, and geographic presence.

Using MySQL, this project analyzed employee, department, job, and country-level data to uncover insights related to workforce size, compensation patterns, and operational gaps. The analysis provides a clear, query-driven overview of the organization’s workforce and highlights areas for strategic attention, including high-earning roles, salary concentration by country, and job roles without assigned employees.

## Business Problem
As a multinational consulting and technology firm, Orion Data Systems operates across multiple countries and departments. However, decision-makers lacked a structured analytical view of their workforce data.

The objective of this project was to use SQL to transform raw HR data into actionable insights that support workforce planning, compensation benchmarking, and organizational optimization.

### Key Questions Addressed
- How are employees distributed across departments?
- Which departments and job roles command the highest average salaries?
- How are employees distributed across salary bands?
- What is the company’s workforce and salary footprint across countries?
- Are there job roles currently unfilled within the organization?
