## Executive Summary
Orion Data Systems required deeper visibility into its workforce data to support strategic human resource and operational decisions. The HR & Strategy team needed answers to key questions around employee distribution, salary structure, job roles, and geographic presence.

Using MySQL, this project analyzed employee, department, job, and country-level data to uncover insights related to workforce size, compensation patterns, and operational gaps. The analysis provides a clear, query-driven overview of the organization’s workforce and highlights areas for strategic attention, including high-earning roles, salary concentration by country, and job roles without assigned employees.
